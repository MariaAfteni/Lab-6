-> Introduced the MVP design pattern:
  - Model contains all the logic and the data manipulations;
  - View  consists of methods that output the results;
  - Presenter takes the changes made in Model and alters the View with the changes from the Model;
-> Implemented Dependency Inversion by creating a interface for the MVP classes, so the low-level classes depend on
the abstraction.
-> Refined Single Responsibility
